## What Is a Product Landing Page?
(https://www.seedprod.com/product-landing-page-examples/)
A product landing page is a standalone web page designed to promote or sell products or services. Visitors can find your product page after clicking a paid ad, a link in your email newsletter, a social media post, or even search results.

After landing on your site, your product page’s job is to compel visitors to join your email list as a lead or commit to buying the products or services it promotes.

It’s not just a single product you can promote on this type of page. Product landing pages also work great for selling:

- Digital products like online courses and ebooks
- Physical products from your eCommerce store
- Memberships for your online community or subscription service

In the end, your product landing page should include everything a visitor needs to make a purchase decision.

## Objective
Build an app that is functionally similar to [https://product-landing-page.freecodecamp.rocks](https://product-landing-page.freecodecamp.rocks)

## User Stories:

1. Your product landing page should have a `header` element with a corresponding `id="header"`
2. You can see an image within the `header` element with a corresponding `id="header-img"` (A logo would make a good image here)
3. Within the #header element, you can see a `nav` element with a corresponding `id="nav-bar"`
4. You can see at least three clickable elements inside the nav element, each with the class `nav-link`
5. When you click a `.nav-link` button in the `nav` element, you are taken to the corresponding section of the landing page
6. You can watch an embedded product video with `id="video"`
7. Your landing page has a `form` element with a corresponding `id="form"`
8. Within the form, there is an `input` field with `id="email"` where you can enter an email address
9. The `#email` input field should have placeholder text to let users know what the field is for
10. The `#email` input field uses HTML5 validation to confirm that the entered text is an email address
11. Within the form, there is a submit `input` with a corresponding `id="submit"`
12. When you click the `#submit` element, the email is submitted to a static page (use this mock URL: [https://www.freecodecamp.com/email-submit](https://www.freecodecamp.com/email-submit))
13. The navbar should always be at the top of the viewport
14. Your product landing page should have at least one media query
15. Your product landing page should utilize CSS flexbox at least once

Fulfill the user stories and pass all the tests below to complete this project. Give it your own personal style. Happy Coding!
